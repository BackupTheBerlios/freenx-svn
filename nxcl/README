  nxcl: A library for building NX clients.

  Seb James. July-September 2007. seb@esfnet.co.uk

Based on nxclientlib by George Wright, but with all dependencies on Qt
removed and the Qt build system replaced with GNU autotools.

doxygen is required if you want to build source documentation.

The library code is in nxcl-release/lib/. 

A binary, called nxcl - the "nxcl dbus daemon" is built in
nxcl-release/nxcl/. nxcl links to libnxcl and can negotiate an nx
connection.

nxcl-release/test/ contains some test programs. notQtTest tests some
of the features of the notQt classes in nxcl-release/lib/. libtest
is a simple command line NX client linking straight to the libnxcl
library. nxcmd is a second command line NX client, but it launches
nxcl, then sends session data there and allows nxcl to negotiate the
NX connection. This could be extended into quite a complete command
line NX client.

A GTK+ NX client called nxlaunch is distributed separately. Nxlaunch
uses the nxcl daemon, though it would be quite possible to write a GTK
client which links directly to the nxcl library. 

You should study nxcmd.cpp and nxlaunch if you are interested in
writing an NX client using a different widget system (say Windows, Qt,
Tk, etc) which uses the Nxcl dbus daemon.

Look at nxcl.cpp/h if you want to write an NX client which links
directly to libnxcl.

Building:

If you checked out the svn code, you need to do:

autoconf -is

then:

./configure [--enable-debug-output]
make
make install
