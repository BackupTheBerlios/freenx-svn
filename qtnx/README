  qtnx: A Qt-based NX client linking to nxcl

  George Wright. January 2008. gwright@kde.org

This is an update of the experimental QtNX client which was based on the
now deprecated NXClientLib backend library. This is an experimental port
to Seb James' nxcl library.

Building qtnx
-------------

Prerequisites are:

* libXcomp from NoMachine, provided by the nxcomp package.
* nxssh from NoMachine
* nxproxy from NoMachine
* nxcl from the FreeNX subversion repository

(These three NX components all should be from the 3.x.x series. You can
obtain them from NoMachine's servers at http://www.nomachine.com/sources.php)

Read the nxcl README for details of the first three packages.

To build QtNX you will need Qt 4.x. You need to run the following commands:

qmake
make

This will generate a qtnx binary in that directory; install it to /usr/bin
or anywhere you want.
