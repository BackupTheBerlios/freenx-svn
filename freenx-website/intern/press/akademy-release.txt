What customers say about FreeNX at aKademy in Malaga, Spain:

[FIXME: Approve those two statements]

KDE/Konqueror developer Daniel Teske says: "It was easy to install, easy to use and it is blazingly fast. I was working here from Spain on my home machine in Germany without any problems."

Stephan Kulow was using it since day 2 of aKademy: "I was working in my company all day long once I had it installed".

[FIXME: More statements?]

Now let us give you some details about the new release:

Easiest installation ever
-------------------------

The setup program of FreeNX 0.4.5 is now interactive, checks for a correct configuration and has automatic self-tests and a help system.

Important changes:

* nxsetup is now interactive. Use --auto to disable this.
* NoMachine key is now the default, but the user still has to confirm it.
  [FIXME]
* nxsetup checks for a correct configuration file. Use --ignore-errors to continue nxsetup even when the check fails.
* If the automatic self-test fails nxsetup reminds the user of some common pitfalls.

Work better, faster, and more colorful (NX 1.5.0)
-------------------------------------------------

FreeNX 0.4.5 has full support for the most important 1.5.0 features.

Your virtual Desktop is now resizable. Just drag the borders and if you want to switch to/from fullscreen mode just press Ctrl+Alt+F.

FreeNX 0.4.5 supports the fast single application mode. To enable this feature, set ENABLE_ROOTLESS_MODE="1" in node.conf. From your client select a Unix-Custom "Floating windows" session and booh: You are up and running remote applications blazingly fast. 

Truecolor Windows Sessions are now supported by FreeNX. Just use the 1.5.0 client and select from the Display-box "Use custom settings, Modify, Allowed Colors '16M'".

Use FreeNX in restricted environments
-------------------------------------

Imagine the following scenario:

You have a really nice remote access to a machine in your company and you would love to use FreeNX to do your everyday work. But the problem is: You do not have root access and so you can't use it. FreeNX 0.4.5 enables you do to it nevertheless.

You can install FreeNX 0.4.5 in a special mode to access it directly via your user account. The only problem remaining is patching the client and setting it all up.

Fux has explained this in detail in a howto available from:

http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=FreeNX_Howto

FreeNX plans to ship ready-made plug-and-play binary distributions of NX4MyHome as soon as all tests are finished.

Easily get help for your problems
---------------------------------

We have several scenarios that come up over and over again. There are many different distributions all doing things a bit different. But you can't give "test this" and "test that" instructions without knowing a lot about the environment of the user.

For example starting up nxagent over a ssh -X connection to test if the basic functionality works can now be done via:

nxserver --agent :1000

instead of:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/where/nx/libs/live /where/nxagent/is :1000

It should now be a lot easier to give advise.

Better support for big corporate environments
---------------------------------------------

Thanks to the help of Google and Cisco employees FreeNX does now work also in environments where you have 1000 users or more.

Technically speaking: getent does no longer retrieve the whole database and grep through it, but directly query for the information needed.

Lots of bugfixes, more stability and improved security
------------------------------------------------------

We also again had several bugfixes:

	* Fixed support for CUPS forwarding.
	* Fixed resume with 1.5.0 client.

Stability has been increased in the following fields:

	* Reconnection support. (Yes, again)

Security issues / concerns have been fixed regarding the following topics:

        * Certain passwords for VNC/RDP could have been visible via `ps aux`.
	* Privacy of passwords is assured. They are no longer shown in log files or re-transmitted to the client.
	* $USER_FAKE_HOME/.nx is now protected.
	* The client is no longer able to overwrite parameters set by the server.
 
And last but not least:

This release for the first time features a really nice background picture. Show your appreciation of FreeNX and use it on one of your desktops as a background. 

Whenever you show off FreeNX, be sure to use it and spread the word!
