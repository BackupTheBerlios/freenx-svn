How to test out the client library.

First, you will need Qt 4 (I am developing against 4.1.4).

Compile Qt as usual, then set QTDIR to point to the directory that
Qt has been installed to (default is /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-x.y.z).

Set PATH to include the path which contains nxssh and nxproxy
(this is /usr/NX/bin on most systems), and $QTDIR/bin. Set
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include /usr/NX/lib, . and ..

Run qmake inside the nxclientlib directory, then run make. After that
has finished, run qmake inside qt-test and run make again. This will
build nxclientlib and the qt-test frontend.

You can then just run qtnx inside the qt-test directory and it should
work. Just type in all the session parameters in the various boxes
and then hit "Connect". There is logging output to stderr/stdout
which shows all the nxssh data.

At the moment you can only use the default NoMachine public key
for authentication.
